## Preface

Books are among the oldest and most important means of information distribution known to humanity. From Ancient China to Renaissance Europe books sparked scientific and political revolutions, and have become the strongest pillar, on which our enlightened information society stands.

Especially in the last two centuries, the creation, manufacturing and distribution of books has sprouted a complex industry of many actors and even more processes. While very successful during this time, the advent of electronic information technology and its tidal waves of velocity and altered consumer behaviour, require a significant evolution of the publishing industry to protect its leading role in information distribution.

## Actual mission statement (can be used with or without preface)

It is our mission to extend the publishing industry's leading role in information distribution well into the 21st century, by nurturing new data-driven opportunities, business models and efficiency gains, while preserving the unique character of our craft.

We are doing this by creating and promoting open, simple, and clever means for data exchange, which are designed from the ground up with the entire value chain in mind, from the author to the reader and back.

We can only succeed by leaving no stone unturned and questioning everything we took for granted for so long. To accomplish this, everybody is invited to join us. Together we can use information technology to the advantage of our readers, authors, customers, manufacturers, distributors and, last but not least, ourselves.
