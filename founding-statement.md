Integrating the Publishing Environment â€“ founding statement
-----------------------------------------------------------

Leiden, 19 January 2018

Following a conference held in Leiden on January 18 and 19 we, the undersigned, declare our support for the initiative to promote a radical degree of global interoperability and process digitization within the Publishing Industry. This initiative will be known as Integrating the Publishing Environment. We believe strongly that this integration is necessary for our industry to meet the challenges we face today and in the future.

In founding the IPE initiative, we commit to adopting the well - established process and governance elaborated over the years by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), the global initiative to achieve similar goals in the health industry, specifically the concepts of wholly non-exclusive and fair participation and complete transparency about the process followed.

IPE follows the IHE process, which is to profile existing standards into standardized application scenarios that are applicable to highly specific use cases brought to the initiative by users or vendors in the industry. Users and vendors then collaborate in developing mutually agreed profiles. For more information please refer to https://www.ihe-europe.net/.

To achieve a critical mass quickly, we commit to reaching out to our industry contacts to motivate them to participate in IPE. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of existing standardization initiatives within the publishing industry, and given our goal to apply existing standards as much as possible, we especially invite these initiatives to engage with us. We seek collaboration across all stakeholders in the value chain including customers, publishers, printers, printing machine industry, software vendors, distributors, paper vendors, wholesalers and retailers. We will reach out to existing standardization efforts in other verticals in order to contribute to maximum integration across the digital economy. We further commit to collaborating in order to select a first set of Profiles to be elaborated and then activating our industry partners to start development.

As this effort develops, we will start implementing the governance structure referenced above. Until that time, spokespersons for the initiative are [Michaela Philipzen](michaela.philipzen@ullstein-buchverlage.de) and [Alexander Markowetz](alexander@markowetz.de).
